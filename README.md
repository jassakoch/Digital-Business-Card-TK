# Digital Business Card

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-v17.0.2-blue)

## Description

This project is a digital business card built using React. The goal was to create an interactive and visually appealing digital business card that can be easily shared and viewed online. 

- **Motivation**: To create a modern, easily shareable business card that stands out and provides all necessary contact information in a sleek design.
- **Why**: Traditional paper business cards are easy to lose and are not environmentally friendly. A digital version can be shared via a link and updated easily without the need for reprinting.
- **Problem Solved**: This project provides a way to share contact information digitally and ensures that it is always accessible and up-to-date.
- **What I Learned**: Enhanced skills in React, CSS Flexbox, and deploying applications on Netlify.
